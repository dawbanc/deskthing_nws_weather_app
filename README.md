Deskthing: National Weather Service App 

Somewhat of a fork of Riprod's weather app that uses the NWS api instead of OpenMeteo API to get more accurate weather information in the US. (https://github.com/ItsRiprod/Deskthing-Apps/tree/master/weather)

May decide on some different style later in the project to show forecast.
